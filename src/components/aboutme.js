        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I’m a recent Computer Science graduate eager 
          to begin my professional career as a software developer. 
          I have a solid foundation in programming, 
          teamwork and problem-solving. My interests 
          include multi-agent systems, agent-based 
          simulations and ethical AI—particularly how 
          intelligent agents operate in complex environments 
          and how technology can be developed responsibly. <br/>

          When I’m not at my computer, 
          I enjoy keeping fit through running, weightlifting 
          and hiking. I also love bringing people together 
          by hosting themed supper clubs. 
          I’m keen to join an innovative team where 
          I can contribute, grow and help create impactful software.
